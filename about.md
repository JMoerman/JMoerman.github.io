Hi I'm Jonathan. I like to make or fix stuff. My hobbies are drawing, nature photography, coding, to name a few.

I'm currently studying computer science at the Radboud university in Nijmegen.

## Computer science, programming
Prior to going to university all I knew about programming was self taught. My first experience with programming was making small games and messing around with existing games with GameMaker. Aside from messing around with game maker I liked to improve my setup on the living room desktop, customizing it to my liking. In 2010, after using Mandriva for a bit I rediscovered Ubuntu\*, the freedom of configuration it and the software available for it offered further fueled my interest in software. I used to think that I would like to become a botanist, but I found that computer science was a better match. A few years later I became a computer science student at the Radboud university, and I've never regretted that choice.
I mainly program in Vala, but I also have experience with working with C, Python, Java and Javascript.

\*_My first attempt to use it was ~two years prior, but the 12/13 year old me got too confused, I was trying to install .tar.gz files and gave up._
