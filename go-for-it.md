This video shows a very old version of _Go For It!_, but most of what is shown still applies to the current version.

### Timer

The timer helps you to focus on the current task by dividing your time in to sessions to be productive followed by a short break.
By default every break has the same lenght, but if you are a fan of the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), _Go For It!_ can be configured to work as a pomodoro timer in just a few clicks.

### Storage and Synchronization

_Go For It!_ uses the [Todo.txt](https://todotxt.github.io) format to store its To-Do lists. This format is supported by a wide selection of apps for both the desktop and mobile phones.

### Download and Installation
