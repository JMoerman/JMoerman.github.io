_Go For It!_ is now available on elementary OS AppCenter!

If you are using elementary OS and currently have _Go For It!_ installed from ppa, please remove the ppa and deinstall it and reinstall it using AppCenter.
(Your settings and todo list will not be affected by this.)

The version available on AppCenter will be configured with elementary OS in mind to ensure a more consistent user experience on elementary OS.
(It won't make a gigantic difference at this moment.) 

If you aren't using elementary OS nothing should change for you.
